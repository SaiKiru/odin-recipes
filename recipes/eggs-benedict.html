    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>To Make Hollandaise: Fill the bottom of a double boiler part-way with water. Make sure that water does not
          touch the top pan. Bring water to a gentle simmer. In the top of the double boiler, whisk together egg yolks,
          lemon juice, white pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon water.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Add the melted butter to egg yolk mixture 1 or 2 tablespoons at a time while whisking yolks constantly. If
          hollandaise begins to get too thick, add a teaspoon or two of hot water. Continue whisking until all butter is
          incorporated. Whisk in salt, then remove from heat. Place a lid on pan to keep sauce warm.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven on broiler setting. To Poach Eggs: Fill a large saucepan with 3 inches of water. Bring water to
          a gentle simmer, then add vinegar. Carefully break eggs into simmering water, and allow to cook for 2 1/2 to 3
          minutes. Yolks should still be soft in center. Remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon and set on a warm
          plate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>While eggs are poaching, brown the bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat and toast the English
          muffins on a baking sheet under the broiler.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Spread toasted muffins with softened butter, and top each one with a slice of bacon, followed by one poached
          egg. Place 2 muffins on each plate and drizzle with hollandaise sauce. Sprinkle with chopped chives and serve
          immediately.</p>
